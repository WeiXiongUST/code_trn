        "solution": "The non-filler weight in the burger is the difference between the total weight of the burger and the weight of the fillers. \n\nThe total weight of the burger is given as 120 grams and the weight of the fillers is 30 grams. \n\nSo, the non-filler weight in the burger is: \n\nNon-filler weight = Total weight of the burger - Weight of the fillers = 120 grams - 30 grams = 90 grams.\n\nTo find the non-filler weight percentage, we need to express the non-filler weight as a percentage of the total weight of the burger.\n\nNon-filler weight percentage = (Non-filler weight / Total weight of the burger) * 100.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nNon-filler weight percentage = (90 grams / 120 grams) * 100 = 0.75 * 100 = 75%.\n\nTherefore, the non-filler weight percentage in the burger is $\\boxed{75\\%}$.
