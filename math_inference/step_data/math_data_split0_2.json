        "solution": "Let's denote the given sequence of matrices as $A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots, A_{99}$.\n\nTo find the product of these matrices, we need to multiply them in the given order. That is,\\[A_1 \\cdot A_2 \\cdot A_3 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot A_{99}\\].\n\nWe can see that each matrix in the sequence has the same structure: the first column is always $\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, and the second column has consecutive odd numbers starting from $1$. \n\nWe can write the given sequence of matrices in a more convenient form by using the general expression for the $i$th matrix in the sequence, where $i$ is the index of the matrix.\n\nLet's write $A_i$ as\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2i-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\].\n\nNow, let's compute the product of all these matrices.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA_1 \\cdot A_2 \\cdot A_3 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot A_{99} &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 99 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2(1)-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2(2)-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2(3)-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2(99)-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 197 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can see a pattern in this product of matrices. \n\nWhen we multiply two matrices of the form\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\], the resulting matrix will have the same form. The first column will be $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ as before, and the second column will be the sum of the second columns of the two matrices. That is, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a+b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nUsing this pattern, we can simplify the product of matrices as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA_1 \\cdot A_2 \\cdot A_3 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot A_{99} &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 197 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1+3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3+5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 197+199 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 8 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 396 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nContinuing this pattern, we find that the product of all the matrices\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\dots, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 99 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]is given by\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & (1+3+5+\\dots+99) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\].\n\nTo find the sum $1+3+5+\\dots+99$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series with first term $1$, last term $99$, and common difference $2$.\n\nThe sum is given by\\[\\frac{n}{2}(a_1+a_n)\\], where $n$ is the number of terms and $a_1$ and $a_n$ are the first and last terms, respectively.\n\nIn this case, $n = \\frac{99-1}{2}+1 = 50$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_n = 99$. \n\nTherefore, the sum $1+3+5+\\dots+99$ is given by\\[\\frac{50}{2}(1+99) = 25 \\cdot 100 = 2500.\\]\n\nHence, the product of all the matrices is given by\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & (1+3+5+\\dots+99) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2500 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the outcome when the sequence of matrices is multiplied together is $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2500 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$ The answer is: \\begin{pmatrix}1&2500\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}",

        "solution": "Let's denote the given sequence of matrices as $A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots, A_{99}$.\n\nTo find the product of these matrices, we need to multiply them in the given order. That is,\\[A_1 \\cdot A_2 \\cdot A_3 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot A_{99}\\].\n\nWe can see that each matrix in the sequence has the same structure: the first column is always $\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, and the second column has consecutive odd numbers starting from $1$. \n\nWe can write the given sequence of matrices in a more convenient form by using the general expression for the $i$th matrix in the sequence, where $i$ is the index of the matrix.\n\nLet's write $A_i$ as\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2i-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\].\n\nNow, let's compute the product of all these matrices.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA_1 \\cdot A_2 \\cdot A_3 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot A_{99} &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 99 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2(1)-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2(2)-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2(3)-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2(99)-1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 197 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can see a pattern in this product of matrices. \n\nWhen we multiply two matrices of the form\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\], the resulting matrix will have the same form. The first column will be $\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ as before, and the second column will be the sum of the second columns of the two matrices. That is, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a+b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nUsing this pattern, we can simplify the product of matrices as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA_1 \\cdot A_2 \\cdot A_3 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot A_{99} &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 197 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1+3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3+5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 197+199 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 8 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 396 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nContinuing this pattern, we find that the product of all the matrices\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\dots, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 99 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]is given by\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & (1+3+5+\\dots+99) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\].\n\nTo find the sum $1+3+5+\\dots+99$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series with first term $1$, last term $99$, and common difference $2$.\n\nThe sum is given by\\[\\frac{n}{2}(a_1+a_n)\\], where $n$ is the number of terms and $a_1$ and $a_n$ are the first and last terms, respectively.\n\nIn this case, $n = \\frac{99-1}{2}+1 = 50$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_n = 99$. \n\nTherefore, the sum $1+3+5+\\dots+99$ is given by\\[\\frac{50}{2}(1+99) = 25 \\cdot 100 = 2500.\\]\n\nHence, the product of all the matrices is given by\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & (1+3+5+\\dots+99) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2500 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the outcome when the sequence of matrices is multiplied together is $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2500 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$ The answer is: \\begin{pmatrix}1&2500\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}",
