        "solution": "First, let's simplify each term in the denominator:\n \nFor $\\sqrt{108}$, we can simplify it by finding the largest perfect square that divides 108. Since 36 is the largest perfect square that divides 108, we can rewrite $\\sqrt{108}$ as $\\sqrt{36\\cdot3}$. Breaking it down further, we have $\\sqrt{36}\\cdot\\sqrt{3}=6\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor twice the square root of 12, we have $2\\sqrt{12}$. We can simplify this term by finding the largest perfect square that divides 12. Since 4 is the largest perfect square that divides 12, we can rewrite $\\sqrt{12}$ as $\\sqrt{4\\cdot3}$. Breaking it down further, we have $\\sqrt{4}\\cdot\\sqrt{3}=2\\sqrt{3}$. So, twice the square root of 12 is $2\\cdot2\\sqrt{3}=4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor twice the square root of 27, we have $2\\sqrt{27}$. We can simplify this term by finding the largest perfect square that divides 27. Since 9 is the largest perfect square that divides 27, we can rewrite $\\sqrt{27}$ as $\\sqrt{9\\cdot3}$. Breaking it down further, we have $\\sqrt{9}\\cdot\\sqrt{3}=3\\sqrt{3}$. So, twice the square root of 27 is $2\\cdot 3\\sqrt{3}=6\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, let's substitute these simplified terms back into the original fraction:\n$$\\frac{4}{{\\sqrt{108}+2\\sqrt{12}+2\\sqrt{27}}}=\\frac{4}{{6\\sqrt{3}+4\\sqrt{3}+6\\sqrt{3}}}=\\frac{4}{{16\\sqrt{3}}}$$\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$:\n$$\\frac{4\\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{16\\sqrt{3}\\cdot \\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{16\\cdot 3}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{48}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$$\n\nThus, the simplified fraction, after rationalizing the denominator, is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}}$.
