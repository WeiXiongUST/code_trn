        "solution": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be the vertices of the quadrilateral in counter-clockwise order, and let $M$, $N$, $P$, and $Q$ be the midpoints of sides $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, $\\overline{CD}$, and $\\overline{DA}$, respectively.\n\nLet $(x, y)$ denote the coordinates of a point in the Cartesian plane.  Then the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices is $$x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D = 20.$$Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, its $x$-coordinate is simply the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, so $x_M = \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2}$.  Similarly, we have $x_N = \\frac{x_B + x_C}{2}$, $x_P = \\frac{x_C + x_D}{2}$, and $x_Q = \\frac{x_D + x_A}{2}$.\n\nAdding these equations, we get $$x_M + x_N + x_P + x_Q = \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2} + \\frac{x_B + x_C}{2} + \\frac{x_C + x_D}{2} + \\frac{x_D + x_A}{2}.$$Combining like terms, we have \\begin{align*}\nx_M + x_N + x_P + x_Q &= \\frac{x_A + x_D + x_B + x_C}{2} + \\frac{x_B + x_C + x_A + x_D}{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2x_A + 2x_B + 2x_C + 2x_D}{2} \\\\\n&= x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D = \\boxed{20}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides of the quadrilateral is also $20$.
