Therefore, there is only one possible color for region B. ки\nStep 8: For region C, since it shares a side with region B, it cannot have the same color as region B. Therefore, there is only one possible color for region C. ки\nStep 9: Finally, for region D, since it shares a side with region A, it cannot have the same color as region A. Therefore, there is only one possible color for region D. ки\nStep 10: Given that there are 2 possible colors for region A, and only 1 possible color for each of the other regions, the total number of possible ways to color the grid is 2 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 2. ки\nStep 11: Therefore, the value of $X$ is 2.
